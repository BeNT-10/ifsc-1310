# IFSC-1310

## Web Technologies

This repository showcases the projects and assignments completed as part of my Web Technologies course during my freshman year at university. The course aimed to introduce new computer science students to the foundational web development languages - HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, through the creation of website components.<br>

The repository highlights my progression from initial concepts to a fully functional website. A notable feature of my work is the interactive sidebar/dropdown menu, made solely with HTML and CSS.<br>
