                <h2>The Tree That Almost Caused WWIII</h2>
                <h3>Preface</h3>
                <p>
                    Tensions at Korea's DMZ were still high far after the Korean War "ended." These tensions came to a head during the summer of 1976, when South Korea
                    decided that a 100 foot tall tree in the middle of the DMZ needed to be removed because it obscured a North Korean observation post.
                </p>
                <p>
                    North Korea, however, didn't like that idea.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When 5 South Korean soldiers and 11 American soldiers went to trim the tree, about 40 North Korean soldiers were sent to stop them. 
                    After the North Korean soliders observed the South Koreans and Americans trimming the tree for about 15 minutes, they abruptly ordered them to stop. 
                    The South Korean and American soldiers refused to comply with these orders, and the North Koreans reacted by <em> attacking and 
                    killing </em> two Americans, which caused the rest of the soldiers to flee the scene. The fight lasted about 20 seconds.

               <h3>The Beginning of Operation Paul Bunyan</h3>
               <p>
                The sitting United States president at that time, President Gerald Ford, was immediately contacted and informed about the situation.
                After convening with South Korean leaders, the plan Operation Paul Bunyan was created - it's mission?

               <p><strong>Cut down that tree.</strong></p>

               <h3>The Suit-Up Phase</h3>
               <p>
                On August 21st, three days after the killing, the United States and South Korea prepared to execute Operation Paul Bunyan in the following manner:
               </p>
               <ul>
                <li>The bridge North Korean soldiers would have crossed to confront the Americans and South Koreans was armed with bombs ready to detonate at a moment's 
                    notice 
                </li>
                <li>A gun used for demolishing structures was loaded and aimed at the bridge to ensure that if for whatever reason the bombs failed,
                    the bridge could still be destroyed.
                </li>
                <li>Sixty four members of the South Korean Special Forces strapped claymores to their chests, armed themselves with rifles and grenade launchers,
                    set up a sandbag barricade, and dared the North Korean soldiers on the other side to cross the bridge.
                </li>
                <li>A U.S. Infantry company circled the area in utility helicopters.</li>
                <li>Seven Cobra attack helicopters escorted the utility helicopters.</li>
                <li>Multiple B-52 Stratofortresses circled the area.</li>
                <li>Fighter jets from four different air bases accompanied the B-52s in a show of force.</li>
                <li>The U.S. aircraft carrier USS <em>Midway</em> was deployed to the area.</li>
                <li>DEFCON 2 was declared by the order of a U.S. General and 12,000 troops were deployed to the surrounding area.</li>
                <li>Nuclear capable bombers were placed on standby.</li>
                <li>A nearby Japanese airbase was lined with Lockheed C-130s ready to take off at a moment's notice.</li>
               </ul>
               <dl>
                <dt>Claymore:</dt>
                <dd>An anti-personnel mine used primarily in traps.</dd>
                <dt>DEFCON 2:</dt>
                <dd>A military condition indicating that nuclear war is imminent. During this condition, the U.S. Military is capable of deploying anywhere
                    across the globe in under 6 hours.
                 </dd>
               </dl>

               <h3>The Execution</h3>
               <p>On paper, the plan was simple</p>
               <ol>
                <li>Secure the area</li>
                <li>Get soldiers to the tree</li>
                <li>Cut down the tree</li>
                <li>Leave</li>
               </ol>
               <p>And it worked perfectly</p>
               <p>
                At 7AM that morning, a group of 23 American and South Korean vehicles suddenly transported 16 military engineers equipped with 
                chainsaws to cut down the tree in front of North Korean guards. <blockquote>The engineers in the convoy left their vehicles once the convoy arrived and 
                immediately started cutting down the tree while standing on the roof of their truck. The 2nd Platoon truck was positioned to block the Bridge of No Return. 
                The remainder of the task force dispersed to their assigned areas around the tree and assumed their roles of guarding the engineers. <cite>From Wikipedia</cite>
                </blockquote> The convoy was escorted by two security platoons equipped with sidearms. 
                North Korea quickly responded by sending about 200 armed soliders across the bridge in buses, which promptly set up machine gun nests pointing across
                the DMZ. However, after the U.S. Airforce helicopters and jets became visible on the horizon, the North Korean soldiers did nothing but watch
                as the American engineers cut down the tree. 
               </p>

               <h3>The Results</h3>
               <p>
                The aftermath of the successful completion of Operation Paul Bunyan led to mostly diplomatic tensions between North Korea and the United Nations. However, 
                wood from the felled tree was used to make a <q>swagger stick</q> passed on to several U.S. Generals, and the deceased U.S. soldiers had their lives memorialized
                in nearby military facilities.
