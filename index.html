  <h2>Progressive Enhancement Writing Assignment</h2>
  <p class="content">
    Progressive enhancement is one of the many web design strategies that helps web developers keep their work relevent in a rapidly changing ecosystem. Its basic premise states that web developers should design their sites in layers. The first layer is the content layer - one that will be visible to everyone, on every browser. After this layer has been established, a presentation layer should be built on top of it. This layer usually consists solely of CSS, and only dictates the the way the content layer is presented to the user. An initial first draft of the presentation layer should be made of features that will be visible across all browsers. Finally, a user experience layer that surrounds both the content and presentation layers should be made. This layer typically consists of JavaScript functionality, but includes any and all features that turn a website from a piece of reading material into an "experience."</p>
  <p class="content">
    After the first iteration of all the website layers is completed, there should exist a website that can be viewed by any user on any browser. It is now time to "progressively enhance" it. There are many ways to go about this, but the suggested method is to use feature detection to incrementally add functionality across all layers. This is done until the web developer decides that they are happy with the website, or that the website contains the "best" features across all browsers and offers a tailored experience to everyone.

  <h2>Dragon Project Revision and Reflection</h2>
  <p class="content">
    I think that my first draft of the SpaceX Dragon website turned out quite nicely. On the content layer, the website was designed consistently and followed what could be considered "best practices" in the majority of cases. On the presentation layer, the website utilized a color scheme that was easy on the eyes, and could be navigated easily and in a consistent manner. The popout navigation bar in the top right of each page being created without the use of JavaScript was definitely a defining feature of the first iteration of the website that I learned a lot from.
  </p>
  <p class="content">
    No first draft is without its flaws, however. On an accessibility standpoint, the website was very dull. The color scheme left much to be desired in the way of attractiveness, and the colors utilized in the scheme melded together to create a viewing experience that was very dull. Furthermore, several images implemented in the first iteration of the website lacked alt text, a fundamental requirement for non-sighted users taking advantage of screen readers. The navigation bar in the top right, while being techinically impressive, lacked consistent functionality, and was difficult to use if one did not know the cause of its glitchy behavior. Feedback from users who viewed the site recommended the use of more imagery and logos, and more contrast in the color scheme in order to create a viewing experience that was substantially more flashy and official. 
  </p>
  <p class="content">
    My final iteration of the SpaceX Dragon project consisted of the following attempts: revising the website color scheme, adding imagery to the website, and implementing the use of JavaScript to make the website pleasant to navigate. The website color scheme was improved by replacing some colors with those that contrasted well with the background - notably the text color. Imagery was added to the website via a content carousel located immediately before the footer on each page. Vertical branding that could be placed on either empty space next to the content on the page was sought after, but adequate content could not be found. Finally, JavaScript was added to the website in the content carousel, in the navigation bar on the top right, and on the FAQ page. The combination of these changes  improved the accessibility, readability, and functionality of the website.
  </p>
  <p class="content">
    If I were to entirely redo the SpaceX Dragon project, I would begin by improving the directory structure of the website. Throughout both the first and second iterations of the project, multiple stylesheets that contained the same functionality were included in each page. It would make for a much easier design experience if global styles were contained in one stylesheet, and small subsets of unique styles were contained separately. I also would not place the website's presentation first when designing the website, I would instead design the presentation of the website's content around its structure. Overall, however, I think the SpaceX Dragon project turned out quite well, and I learned an immense amount about web design from it.
